					<p>Dimacs International Ltd. is a limited liability Company incorporated under the companies Act Chapter 486 of the Laws of Kenya.
						The company is owned by a group of Senior Retired Military Officers from the three branches of Kenya Defence Forces namely, The Kenya Army, Kenya Air Force and Kenya Navy.
						Other members of the disciplined forces like the Kenya National Police, Kenya Wildlife Services, Kenya Forest Services and other Government Security related agencies have also joined in to become members.
						The company was registered after the realization of the vast wasted knowledge and talent after retirement of disciplined forces personnel.
						Generally in the Defence Forces, people retire on a fixed-age limit pegged on a rank-to-age fixed timeframe. This has resulted in an ever growing “Pool of Young Retired Professionals” who are between early 40s up to 60 years.
						Most of the retirees have had sterling careers spanning over twenty years in the service after intensive training both locally and abroad.
						This brain wastage has resulted in draining the government resources on training people who it expends with before maximum utilization of their professional resources.
						Unfortunately it creates a pool of idle but highly professional and reliable people. Suffice to say that this highly vulnerable group can easily be influenced and manipulated to engage in anti-social activities if their future welfare is not well articulated after retirement.
						In essence, this group is both a ticking time bomb and a goldmine. Dimacs International Ltd. wants to treat it as the latter.
