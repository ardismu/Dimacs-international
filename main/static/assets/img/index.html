						<h2>Who are we?</h2>
						<p>Dimacs International Ltd. is a limited liability Company incorporated under the companies Act Chapter 486 of the Laws of Kenya. The company is owned by a group of Senior Retired Military Officers from the three branches of Kenya Defence Forces namely, The Kenya Army, Kenya Air Force and Kenya Navy. Other members of the disciplined forces like the Kenya National Police, Kenya Wildlife Services, Kenya Forest Services and other Government Security related agencies have also joined in to become members. The company was registered after the realization of the vast wasted knowledge and talent after retirement of disciplined forces personnel. Generally in the Defence Forces, people retire on a fixed-age limit pegged on a rank-to-age fixed timeframe. This has resulted in an ever growing “Pool of Young Retired Professionals” who are between early 40s up to 60 years. Most of the retirees have had sterling careers spanning over twenty years in the service after intensive training both locally and abroad. This brain wastage has resulted in draining the government resources on training people who it expends with before maximum utilization of their professional resources.  Unfortunately it creates a pool of idle but highly professional and reliable people. Suffice to say that this highly vulnerable group can easily be influenced and manipulated to engage in anti-social activities if their future welfare is not well articulated after retirement. In essence, this group is both a ticking time bomb and a goldmine. Dimacs International Ltd. wants to treat it as the latter. </p>

				<h2>Analysis Strategies</h2>
			</header>
					<img id="Strategy" style="" src="images/PicTo.jpg" alt="" />
								
<p></p><strong>Political Analysis</strong>
Unlike most African countries, Kenya has managed to keep its military distinctly separate from civil and government affairs. This will be of great advantage to APL as it seeks to transition retired servicemen into corporate and civilian jobs.  The military is highly esteemed in the eyes of the general populace and thus retired servicemen carry with them a good measure of the public goodwill.
The need for political will in the venture cannot be gainsaid of course. The founders of the company should therefore build relations with the government of the day as a signaling measure to both prospective recruiters and the retired servicemen to have the confidence that this is a company approved by the government of the day.
Companies that recruit ex-servicemen in countries like the US and the UK benefit from tax advantages and are favorably looked upon by society.  It is therefore conceivable that APL will have to occupy a role in society’s conscience; sensitizing society on the need to integrate retired servicemen into the country’s workforce. The uniqueness noted earlier that military is generally apolitical in Kenya, should however be maintained. Attaché Personnel will not be used to further partisan political ambitions.</p>

<p><strong>Economic Environment </strong>
The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) estimated that more than 1.7 million jobs were lost in 2020 due to the economic downturn occasioned by the COVID 19 epidemic. The KNBS went on to state that SMEs in the modern sector were making at least 33 positions redundant due to depressed business and strained cash flows. Whereas this might discourage other investors from setting something new in Kenya, this is exactly the opportunity that Attaché Personnel should exploit.</p>

<p><strong>Technological Environment</strong>
Innovations such as recruitment software (which can be proprietary or bespoke), have made the recruitment process more fluid and less tedious. Kenya is fortunate to have one of the best internet penetration rates in Africa. The most important of these in our view is the recruitment software. Recruiting software makes it easy to optimize and digitize the hiring process, screening resumes and sending out offer letters to potential employers. </p>
<p><strong>Legal Environment</strong>
The success of the military headed Nairobi Metropolitan Services that is run by serving Military General, points to the fact that legislation can be drafted to assist the integration of ex-servicemen into mainstream employment. To this effect, it is suggested that DIL sponsor or support the drafting of a private members bill that will incentive Corporate and other Public/Private Institutions to absorb former servicemen into their companies. The bill could propose benefits such as tax rebates for companies employing ex-servicemen.
If DIL directly sponsors the bill, this will position it as the main proponent or agency in the market that places servicemen into jobs. </p>
